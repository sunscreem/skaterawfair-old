This is the official page to share happenings on with the yearly Skateraw Fair that is held in Newtonhill. 
The Skateraw Fair started off as a 'wee' gala before the war and came back as "its a knockout" competition in 1977. In 1980, an official committee was set up, the name was changed to Skateraw Fair and was decided to have said fair every year. By this point, the fair was held in a marquee. Initially just for the fair and a dance in the evening. This spread to having disco's for the kids in the days leading up to the fair and then the addition of events to include activities for all ages. 
The fair is now held in the Bettridge Centre as is the dance. There is now a family night, football tournaments, a charity match and buss pass bingo.
We are always looking for volunteers so feel free to email/message the page/post on the page or come along to one of our committee meetings!
